don't let me down down down ...
crashing hidden world...
right now i need a miracle..
i think am losing my mind now yeah...
i need you right now...
---first----
where are you now..
atlantis under the sea..
another dream..
the monsters riding wild inside of me..
am faded...so lost...
these shallow waters never met..
what i needed..eternal silence of the sea..am breathing...
where are you now?
under the sea
